  <h1 class="classic">An application that counts the number of vowels in a string. </h1>
  <p>This application has specs detailing each behavior it must exhibit. However, they're out of order! Reorder the
    following list of specs from the simplest possible behavior to the most complex behavior with your partner.</p>
  <p>
    1) The program recognizes vowels in a multiple-word sentence, regardless of capitalization.
    - Input Example: "CATS CATERED THE EVENT"
    - Output Example: 7 <br>
    2) The program recognizes a single vowel in a multiple-character word.
    - Input Example: "cat"
    - Output Example: 1 <br>
    3) The program recognizes a single vowel.
    - Input Example: "a"
    - Output Example: 1 <br>
    4) The program recognizes multiple vowels in a single word.
    - Input Example: "cater"
    - Output Example: 2 <br>
    5) The program recognizes a single vowel, regardless of case.
    - Input Example: "A"
    - Output Example: 1 <br>
    6) The program recognizes all vowels in a multiple-word sentence, regardless of inconsistent capitalization.
    - Input Example: "CaTS CATEReD ThE EveNT"
    - Output Example: 7 <br>
    7) The program ignores non-alphabetical characters, since they cannot be vowels.
    - Input Example: "4%"
    - Output Example: 0 <br>
    8) The program recognizes vowels in a multiple-word sentence.
    - Input Example: "cats catered the event"
    - Output Example: 7

  <div id="leap-year">
    <h2 class="classic">Leap Year</h2>
    <p>Follow along with the leap year lessons to build an application that identifies whether a given year is a leap
      year. Make each of the specs detailed in the leap year lessons "pass" (ie: your program returns the expected
      output for the expected input).</p>
    <p id="specs">
      The program should return when a year is not a leap year.
      (Input Example: 1993, Output Example: false)
      The program should return 'true' for years divisible by 4, since those are leap years.
      (Input Example: 2004, Output Example: true)
      The program should return 'false' for years divisible by 100, since those are not leap years.
      (Input Example: 1900, Output Example: false)
      The program should return ' true' for years divisible by 400, since those are leap years.
      (Input Example: 2000, Output Example: true

    <p>Here are the rules:
      <ol>
        <li>For words beginning with a vowel, add "ay" to the end.</li>
        <li>For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".</li>
        <li>For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.</li>
